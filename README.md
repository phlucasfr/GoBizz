# GoBizz - Business Management System

## üìã About the Project

GoBizz is a modern business management system, built with a distributed architecture using microservices. The project consists of a Next.js frontend and multiple Go backend services communicating via gRPC.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The project is organized into the following main services:

  - `/components` - Reusable components
  - `/context` - React contexts
  - `/api` - API integrations
  - `/utils` - Utility functions
  - `/hooks` - Custom hooks
  - `/lib` - Libraries and utilities
  - `/styles` - Global styles
  - `/public` - Static files

### Authentication Service (`/auth-service`)

- Developed in Go
- Handles user authentication and authorization
- Uses gRPC for service communication
- Directory structure:
  - `/cmd` - Application entry points
  - `/internal` - Service internal code
  - `/middleware` - Middlewares
  - `/migrations` - Database migrations
  - `/proto` - gRPC protocol definitions
  - `/utils` - Utility functions

### Links Service (`/links-service`)

- Developed in Go
- Manages business links and connections
- Uses gRPC for service communication

## üöÄ How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js (LTS version)
- Go 1.21+
- PostgreSQL
- SQLC
- Protocol Buffers (protoc)

### Environment Setup

1. Configure environment variables:

```bash
# In frontend
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env

# In auth-service
cp auth-service/.env.example auth-service/.env

# In links-service
cp links-service/.env.example links-service/.env
```

2. Start services using Docker Compose:

```bash
cd project
make run
```

3. Run the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

4. Run the authentication service:

```bash
cd auth-service
make server
```

5. Run the links service:

```bash
cd links-service
make server
```
